How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fpointed out pretty clearly where the difference was in the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
any time a code breaks or a browser updates I might have to change the code and going back to the old versions will help

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 manually, you have more control and you can play around with the code before committing. but automatic saves time and hassle but you could have a bunch of unwanted saved files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   i think its better to save multiple commits in one save as long as you can group them in a way to comprehend way.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    see the difference between old and new files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    well you can always know that you can go back if something messes up, so your less concerned about completely starting over

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  any thing really, not really sure how the whole thing works yet
